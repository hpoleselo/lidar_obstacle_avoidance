# lidar_obstacle_avoidance
This repository is for documentation purposes regarding Obstacle Avoidance using LiDAR on a mobile robot.

## [Running Sample PCL and Algorithms](https://github.com/hpoleselo/lidar_obstacle_avoidance/tree/main/reference/downsampling)

To get started into the subject of Point Clouds, there's a `reference` directory where I tested some of the foundational algorithms using both `CPP` and `Python`. Just click the header of this section and you'll be redirected to the README containing the guidance for running the algorithms.

## Requirements

`
$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-pcl-ros
