# lidar_obstacle_avoidance
This repository is for documentation purposes regarding Obstacle Avoidance using LiDAR on a mobile robot.

To get started into the subject of Point Clouds, there's a `reference` directory where I tested some of the foundational algorithms using both `CPP` and `Python`. Just click the header of this section and you'll be redirected to the README containing the guidance for running the algorithms. While for more advanced applications involving ROS and real-time clustering - and offline processing too! - the [ROS Package to Run Clustering Algorithms on a Mobile Robot](#ros-package-to-run-clustering-algorithms-on-a-mobile-robot) section can be useful.
